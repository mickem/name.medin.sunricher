Triple press the “Inclusion/Exclusion” button, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.\n2) When the connected LED light is under solid on status, it means the LED dimmer has already been included into a network. First you have to set the LED dimmer into exclusion mode, once excluded, it will be set into inclusion mode automatically, and waiting to be included.\nThe connected LED light stays solid on 3s to indicate successful inclusion."
